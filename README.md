About The Document
This is a research work that explains how web browsers work. These programs, also called clients, come in different flavours and versions, like Internet Explorer for Windows or Safari for Macs or Firefox which can run on several different operating systems.
 Web browsers are what made the web "happen". Before these programs came into existence, the Internet was a pretty bland place, as some would say, with digital information (like text	 documents, images, music files) scattered around with nothing to "link" them up.
